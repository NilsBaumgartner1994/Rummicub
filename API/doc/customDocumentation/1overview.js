/**
 * @api {INTRODUCTION} REST/API 1.1 REST API Choice
 * @apiGroup 1Overview
 * @apiDescription A lot of systems communicate with them self. To support this communication a REST API is a good possibility. A REST API can combine multiple interface and task, so that a shared access from anywhere in a network is possible. Every device which supports a network communication can use the REST API. Further functions can be implemented with low effort.
